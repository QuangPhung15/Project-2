	i. Since we already have the code engine from our lab, we only need to improve it to adapt to the GUI by adding drawX(), drawO(), and drawLine() functions and changing the prBrd() function to draw the board in graphics. Especially adding evalClick() and evalCenter() functions makes it suitable for our code engine since they convert the coordinates of the play's click into the box's number and the box's center. In pTurn(), we used .getMouse() instead of using input() to get user's move. Similarly, in cTurn() function, we converted the computer's random box's number into the box's coordinates. 
	ii. We didn't make any big revisions, just change a couple of variables' and parameters' names and add some missing docstrings.
	iii. At first, we just converted the mouse click coordinates into the center of the boxes to draw X, but then we realized that our code engine in the lab relied mainly on the boxes' numbers. Therefore, we decided to convert mouse click coordinates to numbers before converting them into the center coordinates, which is easy for us to code the validMove and checkWin() function.
