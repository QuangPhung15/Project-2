a. The completed code is in the main.py file

b. The code is completely commented

i. The program successfully fulfills the requirement of the program. Moreover, it runs without any errors. The program was designed to be user-friendly which means it is easy for the user to run, understand and use the program. We also added a While loop which allows the user to re-enter the information without running the program over again. 

ii. Our greatest challenge was to figure out how to make the connection between the graphics and the text-based code engine. 

iii. We figured the challenge out by ourselves and with a little help from the Internet.

iv. We shared our ideas with each other and discussed our ideas to see the pros and cons, and then developed the most efficient ways.

v. If we had more time, we would add the play again option, and display the winner declaration on the graphWin.

vi. We can use the function of this challenge not only to create the Tic Tac Toe game but also to apply those functions to other games.
